    <h1>Hello Everyone and Welcome to my WebPage!</h1>
    
  <p>I present here my web page which I'm developing over time while studying in the class of csc 106<br>
      (computer programming course) at the University of Rhode Island, located in the USA, RI.<br>
      Feel free to press the Javascripts buttom which would show you the Javascripts that I have done<br> 
      in this class, the App buttom which would lead you to the apps that I have wrote for this<br>
      course and  if you are interested in who I'm, press the About me buttom.</p><br>
